An Introduction to Programming and Computing:
---------------------------------------------

This repository consist of multiple exercises from the
book - "How to Design Programs". The book aims at teaching
everyone to design programs. It uses the Scheme Programming
language to define the course.

If anyone is looking at this repo and wants to understand any
part of the exercise then, you can add a comment, pr or raise an
issue. This would be highly appriciated. It always helps to learn more!

I am very excited to learn Scheme! So lets get started :)
